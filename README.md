This user appears to keep an air of mystery about themselves.
You can't name it, but there's an ominous feeling around them.
You meet their steady gaze and a thought enters your mind.
_There's nothing to see here_
You realize that you've stopped smiling, and quickly fix your expression.
Walking away, you repeat that mantra to yourself.
_There's nothing to see here_
